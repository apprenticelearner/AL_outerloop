#######
# This version of the BKT controller updates
# mastery probabilities by treating every interface component
# (in the Selection field) as a separate KC, and choosing a 
# problem with the most unmastered KCs. It must be used with
# an action_space that specifies the KCs in the problem set. 
# Chooses a problem with the maximum number of unm
#
# Options specifiable via outerloop_args:
# bkt_probs (required) : Specifies the BKT probabilities for each skill:
#        - known: the probability the skill is already learned before any practice attempts
#        - learn: the probability of learning the skill on a single practice attempt
#        - guess: the probability a learner will answer correctly despite not knowing a skill
#        - slip: the probability a learner will answer incorrectly despite knowing a skill 
# num_test_problems : number of problems to use for testing (not training);
#    these problems will be the final problems specified in the action_space.
# interface_to_skill : a mapping between each interface component and skill 
#     If not included, raw interface components are skills. If this maps everything
#     to an empty string, than include_problem_start_in_kc can be used to map
#     all steps in a problem to the same skill.
# single_kc : all attempts use the same kc
# include_problem_start_in_kc : in addition to the interface component
#     skills will include any part of the problem name that occurs before a space,
#     or if num_chars_problem_start is included as well, that number of characters
#     from the problem name
